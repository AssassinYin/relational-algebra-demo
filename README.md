# Relational Algebra Demo

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **relational algebra**, the theoretical foundation of SQL and relational databases. It provides examples of basic and compound relational algebra operations, allowing users to visualize and understand how complex queries are constructed from simple building blocks.

## Overview

Relational algebra is a formal language for querying and manipulating relational data. This demo project is intended for:

- Students learning about database theory
- Instructors creating teaching materials
- Anyone interested in understanding how SQL maps to relational algebra

## Features

- Example implementations of basic relational algebra operators:
  - Selection (sigma)
  - Projection (pi)
  - Cartesian product
  - Union
  - Difference
  - Rename
- Sample datasets and output for each operation
